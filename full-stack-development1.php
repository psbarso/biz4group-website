				        	<p>While the front-end includes everything that is involved with the user view, back-end is more concentrated on server-side work, including site works and updates. Web designers and UI/UX designers are also a part of the front-end development team. Delving a bit deeper brings the fact to light that a website can be developed by a front-end developer, but it will be static in nature. Creating a dynamic website always requires back-end development process, as they need constant change and upgradation in content, graphics, and third-party integrations.</p>

Functionality is another factor that affects the timeframe of making a website. Once a custom design is approved, the revisions and reiterations are also required during the testing phase.
