			<h2 class="home-layout-heading-title">Wearable App Development: Wearing the smart tech that fits!</h2>
		</div>
		<p>We have all seen that how likely technology tends to become smaller the more advanced it gets. From computers that occupied the space of an entire room, we now have the fully functional computers that can easily fit on the palm of your hand. Some of the finest examples of this miniaturization of technology come in the form of wearable tech.</p>
		<p>The market of wearable devices grown exponentially in the last decade. The wearable statistics as per the website 3dinsider was 39.5 million in the year 2015, the estimated number of adults in the US to use some sort of wearable devices has grown to 81.7 million in 2018. This figure clearly reflects a good portion of adults who use wearable devices own more than one device. At the Global level, It is estimated that by 2021, the number of wearable devices that will be purchased in the US is expected to reach more than 559 million units.</p>
		<p>Unlike normal mobile applications, Wearable Apps are expected to carry out functions that are a lot more unique and creative in various aspects. For instance, activity tracker apps that keep track of the calories you burn regularly with the help of a smart-watch.</p>
		<p class="services2-layout-text-blod">That all said for the statistics, Let’s look into what is wearable app.</p>

			<h2 class="home-layout-heading-title">The Future Phase of Technology: wearable Apps</h2>
		</div>
		<p>Before going in depths of what Wearable Apps are, we will have to look into what wearable technology is.</p>
		<p>“Wearable Technology is typically that segment of technology devices that are worn by a user either directly as an accessory or as a part of other materials like clothing. These gadgets are then interlinked to the internet directly or through a smartphone to perform a various number of operations by the method of exchange of data between network and devices.”</p>
		<p>The platforms on which these wearable apps either run on or are made compatible with depends on how the input is taken and the result displayed. If the device by itself accepts as well as displays the outcome, for which any platform can be chosen for i.e. whether iOS, Android, Windows or even custom developed one. However, if any device uses a mobile app for the above-given functions, then you would be needing iOS App developers or Android App developers, which will depend on the type of OS you want the device to be compatible with.   For cross-platform compatibility, Xamarin Developers shall prove out to be the best option for you. Thus, conclusively, the development of wearable app development depends on the use of the device by the end user. </p>
		<p>With an estimated revenue of nearly $28 Billion generated in 2016 and with an expected revenue generation of $34 Billion by 2020, wearable devices presents an outlook for greater opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses. The wearable tech market is integrally driven by those applications that fuel these gadgets which are in a wide sense referred to as ‘Wearable Apps’ at present.</p>
		<p>Wearables apps may seem like just as regular apps that we use in smartphones and tablets. However, they do differ in a few key aspects. </p>

			<h2 class="home-layout-heading-title" style="display: inline;">What Separates Wearable Apps from other Smartphone Apps?</h2>
			<p class="home-layout-heading-pera" style="margin-top:10px; text-align: center;">There are some significant aspects that make wearable apps different from smartphone apps, these differentiating factors are:</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="service-provided-tab">
		<ul class="nav nav-tabs">
			<li class="active"><a data-toggle="tab" href="#tab1">Functionality</a></li>
			<li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#tab2">User Interaction</a></li>
			<li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#tab3">Device Specificity</a></li>
		</ul>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="tab-content">
				<div id="tab1" class="tab-pane fade in active">
				    <p>In the current scenario, the hardware that bears the wearable tech is much smaller and less powerful, hence there can be some limitations regarding functionalities of a single wearable app on a device. However, smartphones have grown into fairly advanced technology and hence those apps, in general, tend to have fewer limitations.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="tab2" class="tab-pane fade">
					<p>Wearable Apps in general lack user interactions or in general have little. They work by automatically collecting data and displaying the output. There are very few wearable apps that require input from the user. On the other hand, Mobile Apps are developed by taking user interaction into consideration.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="tab3" class="tab-pane fade">
				    <p>There are APIs that are specific to every device and they tend to vary from device to device, these specific APIs are used by Wearable Apps. Until now, the same wearable apps cannot be used on other devices or even on the same device that is configured by other manufacturers. On the other hand, mobile apps have the flexibility of being run on different platforms that are associated with mobile phones and even tablets.</p>
