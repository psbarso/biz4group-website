				        	<p>At Biz4Group, we keep the security of our solution at top priority. We use an SSL 256-bit encryption in our solution that keeps the data safe when it is communicated between different servers. Also, we use Cognito/IAM services from AWS for proper authentication and authorization. Moreover, we use a single protocol (depending on the client's preference) to maintain a secure data-sharing network between sensors and gateways.</p>
