</p>
<p>We consist of a team of dedicated professionals who are committed to building apps that can maintain agent-buyer communication, broker task management, customer relationship management, and much more. We bring to you a list of factors taken into deep consideration by us to develop a real estate app from the point of view of buyers and brokers.

<h2>Advantages of a Real Estate App for Buyers, Property Owners & Brokers 
</h2>
<h3>Buyers:
</h3>
<img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/Buyers-and-Property-Owners-Brokers.jpg" alt="realestate-buyers" style="padding:6px 0">
<ul>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Filtered and Specific Results:  </strong> Buyers are often looking for detailed information about the property. An app helps them to find what they are looking for. Right from checking the exact location, to access to other parts of the city, maps, etc, an app allows them to discover it all.
</p>
	</li>

		<li>
		<p><strong>Virtual tours:</strong> We are living in a digital world where virtual tours enable users to get a feel of the place and develop long-lasting impressive first impressions. Clear photos/ videos from various angles give buyers a 360-degree narrative to understand and explore the floor plans as though they are physically on-site! 

</p>
	</li>

		<li>
		<p><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Our apps consist of an AI chatbot, that answers customer queries as and when the users have doubts. They also guide the users regarding the property on sale, terms, and conditions, etc. Additionally, customer support increases the credibility of the company in the consumer market.


</p>
	</li>

</ul>

<h2>Property Owners/Brokers:
</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Property Exposure:</strong> Property owners or brokers can list their estates on the app and get a wider audience reach as compared to word of mouth. Brokers can also take this as an opportunity to build on their portfolio of deals.

		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Time-saving:</strong> Consumers are always looking for properties that fit their requirements. A robust and user-friendly app allows them to filter their search and find exactly what they are looking for.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p>
			<strong> Task and Team Management:</strong> Real estate apps act as a medium for relators to streamline their work. From establishing easy and effective communication among various parties to managing leads, we develop customized solutions for you.

		</p>
	</li>

		<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Feedback:</strong> Consumers can give feedback about the broker involved in the deal, the location surrounding the property, and other factors related to the deal. This will not only attract potential customers but also earn recognition for the brand.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/realestate-ROBUST~1.jpg" alt="realestate-ROBUST~1" style="padding:6px 0">
<p>The right choice of the technology stack is essential to determine the functionality and smooth operations of your real estate mobile apps at multiple levels. At Biz4Group we provide you with a wide array of the best technologies in the world. Here are some options for you to consider:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Android:</strong> Java, Kotlin

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong> iOS: </strong>Swift, Objective C

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> React Native, Angular
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Payment gateways: </strong> Stripe, PayPal
		</p>
	</li>
		<li>
		<p>
			<strong> Push Notifications:</strong> Firebase, AWS Simple notification service
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>

		</p>
	</li>

	</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from using scalable technologies to build your application, you need to focus on the database as a separate entity all together! A real estate app should include a robust database since it forms the backbone of the application. Since there will be hundreds of listings for properties on sale, potential buyers should be able to access the property of choice by applying filters. MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL are excellent options to consider while building a robust backend for your application.</p>
