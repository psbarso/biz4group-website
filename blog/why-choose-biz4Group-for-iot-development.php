						<h1>Why Choose Biz4Group for IoT Development?</h1>
						<p>Big IT giants and even many budding start-ups are striving to develop feature-rich and highly intuitive IoT platform that can meet the expectations and needs of their clientele. However, it is rare to come across an IoT service provider that delivers an end-to-end IoT solution jam-packed with required features and functionalities. </p>
						<p>Along with basic real-time monitoring and telemetry features, an IoT solution should also have advanced capabilities like analytics and data pattern recognition. Also, a single-stop IoT solution should compound endpoints, gateways, and a portal for seamless execution, which is generally not the case most of the time. </p>
						<h2>Why is it so Difficult to Find a Good IoT Development Company? </h2>
						<p>Things in the IoT market are changing very rapidly. In the past 20 years of IoT history, technology has upgraded at an unprecedented rate that has made it difficult for people to choose from so many available options. </p>
						<p>Initially, when the technology was picking up speed, many companies started as sole vendors of different components of an IoT solution. For instance, many companies were only selling hardware components while other companies were only providing an IoT platform. </p>
						<p>Hence, people had to find sensors and gateways from the best of breed sellers and check if the devices provided by them work on the communication protocol supported by the platform they obtained from an IoT software development company. In most cases, the clients themselves had to build an IoT platform for their unique requirements.</p>
						<p>This created a major void in the IoT market that was not filled until a few years back.</p>
						<p>In the last 5 to 7 years, many companies that were working on individual components of a complete IoT system have started developing one window solution that doesn’t require users to search for anything else. They are also providing features like data ingestion and processing that makes their solutions one of a kind.</p>
						<p>Still, there are very few IoT development companies that can include all 7 layers of a perfect IoT system in the project they develop. Hence IoT enthusiasts need to find a company that provides a complete package in the form of IoT sensors, gateways, and a seamless platform connected with each other.</p>
