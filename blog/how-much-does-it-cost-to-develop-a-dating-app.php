						<h1>How Much Does It Cost to Develop a Dating App?</h1>
						<p>Are you thinking of making money from mobile apps on a digital platform? Well, quite a good idea, but it requires investment as well. An investment that you need to be careful about so that it doesn’t just get you ROI but also become profitable one in a longer run.</p>
						<h2>From the Old Age Love Story to Modern Days’ Romance</h2>
						<p>Gone are the days when people use to resort to letters for communication, which even involved days and weeks of waiting period. Today’s digital age has brought along the benefits of instant messaging where you can connect with anyone, anywhere in the world. Moreover, giving it a romantic touch, the passion of sharing letters, and the slow romance has been replaced with dating apps that bring you innumerable profiles onto your smartphone. You can easily pick and chat with the person of your choice. And why just chat? Such a <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/blog/4-business-benefits-of-having-a-mobile-app" target="_blank">mobile application</a> enables you to take it ahead as a date. </p>
						<p>Take the example of Tinder, which is today, the leading dating mobile app. Since Tinder entered the online space in 2012, a number of dating apps with countless new features have joined the race. </p>
						<p>As tempting as it seems, developing a dating app that can benefit you financially is a tricky task. You need to render services of an adroit <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank">app development company</a> that can take up the herculean task of shaping the aphrodisiac environment on your dating app. </p>
						<p>As per Statista, the online dating segment is expected to generate a revenue of USD 2141 million in 2020 and further grow with a CAGR of 4.3% till 2024. Yeah! That’s really massive money in the online dating segment. The root questions that can arise here are – How do dating apps make money? And how much is it going to cost to develop a dating app? </p>
						<p>Let’s answer them:</p>
						<h2>The Money-Making Mantra in Dating Apps </h2>
						<p>Usually, the free versions have restricted features, and users are needed to pay extra to unlock the special features. Tinder makes money majorly through in-app advertisements, subscriptions, premium plans, and also in-app purchases, which enables them to change location, rewind the swipes, turn-off advertisements, etc. The other apps like Badoo, Bumble, Happn, Gleeden also jumped the bandwagon and started selling premium features to third-party products in-app ads. </p>
						<p>Dating apps are getting popular at lightning speed and especially targeting Millennials and Gen-Z. The hope of getting a suitable date or a prospective future life-partner brings hoards of the digital age crowd on the dating app platforms. Lastly, these dating apps also have to continually engage the existing customers along with acquiring the new ones. </p>
						<h2>How Much Is It Going to Cost to Develop a Dating App?</h2>
						<p>Based on the app functionality and complexity, a basic dating app for either of the platforms (Android or iOS) can cost you USD 40-50K. Further, if you are intending to get the dating app working for both the platforms, the development cost may reach up to USD 90K or higher. In a nutshell, the more the features, the more the development cost will be. That is why you must set your goals and motives before you step into the market to search the right dating app development company. </p>
						<p>The API design and integration of a dating application typically involve UI/UX designers, Android, iOS, and backend developers, QA engineers, and a project manager to keep the complete work in sync. It is easier to work with an app development company that has a full-fledged team of expert techies to take onto the project of your dream dating app rather than finding different experts and engaging them together. Leading IoT and tech company like <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/" target="_blank">Biz4Group</a> has been an expert in executing such million-dollar projects and helping mobile dating apps in minimizing turn-around time and maximizing ROI. </p>
						<p>As we have already discussed that the more the features, the higher the cost will be; one must keep a set goal of features that he/she wants to deploy in the dating app. Some of the basic features like sign up/ sign in, age restriction, interest scale, create/ edit profile, chat & notification, location setting, discovery setting, expression of interest, user display settings may cost collectively around USD 15-20K. </p>
						<p>Apart from these to stay strong in the competition and have an edge over other dating apps, it has been quintessential for dating apps to have several unique features like image recognition and AI & ML based app development.  </p>
						<p>Your ideation can shape in reality only when you have a perfect app development partner, who can both with its expertise and experience can help you meet your goals and assure you of quality work delivery. Furthermore, the work doesn’t end with just the development of the dating site; instead, it is just the beginning of the journey where time-to-time upgradation are needed. Also, to be the black horse in the race, 24/7 customer support and troubleshooting backup are required, which only a team of tech aficionados like <a href="https://biz4group.com/contact-us/">Biz4Group</a> can provide.</p>
