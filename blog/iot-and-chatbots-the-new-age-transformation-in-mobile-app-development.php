						<h1>IoT and Chatbots – The New Age Transformation in Mobile App Development</h1>
						<p>Internet of Things and AI-powered Chatbots have actually become the buzzwords in the modern industry. Together these two technological breakthroughs have leveled up almost every industry vertical, majorly impacting the communication industry and online business world. </p>
						<p>It is needless to say that with more than 3.5 billion smartphone users spread across the world, the intervention of IoT and Chatbots have transformed the application and usage of mobile apps. This billion-dollar market segment has opened a new avenue for companies, be it a startup, a unicorn, MNC, or any large-scale enterprise. Together, these two have reshaped the <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank"><b>mobile app development</b></a> and realized tasks that were unfathomable once. It’s time we delve deeper into the ocean of knowledge and learn more about what IoT and Chatbots are offering in the field of mobile app development. </p>
						<p>The first question here that barges into the minds of us all is-</p>
						<h2>What all IoT and Chatbots can do in Mobile Apps?</h2>
						<p>Before ‘What,’ ‘Why’ is more important, and that can only be cleared through the facts. As per Statista, the Chatbot market alone is going to reach US$ 1.25 billion by 2025, and a majority of these conversational (Artificial Intelligence-powered) bots will be deployed in mobile apps and progressive web apps. The same statistical source also talks of the Internet of Things, stating that the installed base of IoT devices will reach above 21.5 billion connected devices with a majority share of smartphones by 2025. Third, but the roots without which we can’t comprehend the growth of these two tech variants is the mobile app market. </p>
						<p>Mobile apps are projected to generate a revenue of US $935 billion by 2023, and the figure is all set to grow exponentially.</p>
						<p>Now, when pondering over these statistics, it portends that the promising combination of IoT and Chatbots with Mobile Apps is hauling a multi-million industry vertical. With the right vision and perfect technological alliances, businesses across all verticals can cash this opportunity and grow themselves in the modern digital age. </p>
						<p>The previous decade has exemplified the growth of chatbots that businesses are deploying to improve their customer satisfaction ratio in today’s customer-centric world. Internet of Things, on the other hand, has corresponded to the radical shift that it has brought in industries varying from communication and transport to oil & gas and even entertainment. In our quest to addressing the ‘What’ of these two techs, we are further discussing the ventures of these two in mobile apps. </p>

						<p>Today, conversational marketing and chat services for customers have taken a major share in the modern market. Not just the mobile apps, but even the web pages and sites are also taking into account the deployment of chatbots for an enhanced experience. connecting the dots of chatbots with mobile applications, we can state – </p>
						<p>“Ease of integration, installation, and navigation of the major facets for the integration of chatbots within mobile apps. Chatbots with AI-enabled Machine Learning Algorithms can be easily integrated with a mobile app and doesn’t require additional software on enterprise end. Given the fact that the majority of mobile users spread across the world are Millennials and Generation Z, the time has become of great essence for the modern customer. In this era, they look for a prompt resolution with 24/7 support service availability. Customers who get in touch with a 24/7 chatbot support system are more likely to return to those mobile apps for repetitive services. Even the chatbots have made the messaging program more appealing. Lastly, the social networking aspect has also weighed scale in favor of chatbot integration with mobile apps.”</p>
						<p>The second tool that we are discussing in this article – the Internet of Things, holds an even more significant share on a global level. As we have already discussed, that will be over 21.5 billion devices around the globe by 2025, out of which more than 5.86 billion will be mobile connections as per Statista. That means that mobile and smartphones will account for a quarter of the total connected IoT devices across the world by 2025. In this context, we can deduce that – </p>
						<p>“In the past years, mainstreaming of IoT into mobile devices has brought along the benefits like Seamless coordination with a better business opportunity, greater customer retention, reaching out to the appropriate targeted audience, empowering the customer with a variety of available decisions, data gathering through geo-locating, geo-tracking, CMS, payment gateways, third party APIs, data encrypt and other communication micro-requirements. The portable IoT mobile applications are rapidly reshaping the modern organization. The power of IoT is not just helping organizations in increasing their business but is also bringing a revolution in the customer service segment, helping them sort everything from their normal day-to-day tasks to complicated ones. The multiple connectivity choices that IoT offers via WI-FI, BLT, etc. are definitely giving an extra edge to mobile application in all three kinds of business models – B2B, B2C, and C2C.”</p>
						<h2>Learning the Importance of IoT and Chatbots in Mobile Apps with Practical Examples</h2>
						<p>As we have learned the usage of IoT and Chatbots Integration into modern age mobile apps, let’s consider an example to understand how chatbots and IoT are going to drive the future of mobile applications. </p>
						<p><b>Case 1:</b> Consider that you install the mobile application of a Health Insurance company, and you want to buy the best suitable policy for yourself. With the integrated chatbots that action 24/7, you don’t just get the best suitable policy with the AI-enabled chat conversation. Still, you can even buy the policy just following the guidance of that chatbot. In this way, the chat process enabled with machine learning just doesn’t help you in answering your queries but also helps you navigate throughout the process. Thus, customer satisfaction and company profits are both ensured with the integration of a quality AI-enabled chatbot in the mobile application. </p>
						<p><b>Case 2:</b> A must remember point here is – the ability to connect various mobile apps and sensor devices together. Consider the functioning of a supply chain and logistics company whose services you have rendered. With IoT Integration, you won’t just be able to place your package for its destination, but the mobile app integrated with that company’s IoT sensors and devices will give you real-time status of the package in the delivery process. The same principle of IoT is also getting large implications in the transport and Oil & Gas industry these days, where the enterprises can utilize geo-location, geo-fencing, geo-tagging, and other similar features integrated into the centralized mobile application for smooth and diligent end-to-end functioning. </p>
						<p><b>Case 3:</b> Consider the case of online shopping on Amazon, where you have placed an order for a product. This is an ideal case where both IoT and chatbots show their full potential in helping the customer throughout the process. First, you can simply select a product or even take the help of the chatbots in discovering your choice of product on the Amazon E-commerce platform. Once the order the process, because of the IoT integration at the enterprise end, you can track your order delivery in real-time. Not just this, with the 24/7 chatbots assistance on Amazon, you can also raise a concern, raise a dispute, or any other inquiry related to your order.</p>
						<p>Now think, haven’t these applications and processes made the lives easier for the customers. Absolutely Yes! </p>
						<p>Further, with other technologies such as Cloud Computing and Blockchain, IoT and Chatbots are delivering better experiences to the mobile app users. In a nutshell, it turns as a win-win situation for both customers and the enterprise. </p>
						<h2>The Deduction from The Technological Triangle of Modern Age</h2>
						<p>Every industry vertical ranging from e-commerce to transport and manufacturing and healthcare can gain a lot from the integration of IoT and Chatbots into their mobile applications.
