						<h1>How to Build a Website like Trulia? Features, Technology & Work Hours
</h1>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/Study-Digital-House-Hunt-2013-01_1.pdf" target="_blank"><b>National Association of REALTORS®</b></a> Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, 52% of buyers found the home they purchased on the internet. Real estate websites are visited more than 120 million times each month, with dominant players like Trulia racking up 23 million <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/381468/most-popular-real-estate-websites-by-monthly-visits-usa/" target="_blank"><b>unique</b></a> visitors monthly. Over 90 percent of real estate firms have websites, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). 
</p>
					
					<p>A website will be the perfect medium for consumers to browse to several property listings, based on the desired features, without physically visiting the location. Brokers/ agents/property owners listed on the app can be easily contacted for additional information or to book an appointment to visit the space. 
</p>

<p>This article will outline how to build a real estate website like Trulia, focusing on the features and costs involved in the same.
</p>

<h2>Trulia- A Real Estate Marketplace</h2>

<p>Trulia is one of the biggest names in the US real estate sector. It is an online real estate marketplace that gives the customers relevant information on homes for sale, apartments for rent, neighborhood insights, and real estate market trends. The website lists properties, homeowners who want to sell their homes directly, as well as agents that can help customers strike a deal. 
</p>

<p>The most popular feature amongst the customer base at Trulia is its vast depiction of knowledge of a particular neighborhood. Users can view the property plotted on a map showing neighborhood area crime rates, places to shop, places to eat, educational and financial institutions, and much more! Users can also avail the "save home" option to compile a wishlist of desired home listings for an easier decision-making experience.  
</p>

<h2>Why Should You Create a Real Estate Website like Trulia?

</h2>

	<img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/trulia-Why-Should-You-Create-a-Real-Estate-Website-like-Trulia.jpg" alt="trulia-Why-Should-You-Create-a-Real-Estate-Website-like-Trulia">

<p>Real estate websites add value for both potential buyers and sellers. Buyers can preview hundreds of properties anytime and from the comfort of their homes. Home sellers also gain the added exposure of hundreds of shoppers in the market to buy a new home.
</p>

<p><b>#1 Specific Results to save Time:</b> A website allows potential buyers to filter properties based on their personal requirements. Buyers can also filter properties based on facilities such as schools, hospitals, shopping malls, religious organizations, etc. This can help in quick decision-making since consumers will only look up for properties that fit their requirements.
This is also a boon to brokers/property dealers, who will save time in just dealing with shortlisted options from the consumer's end.
</p>

<p>
<b>#2 Virtual tours:</b> Before physically visiting the location, a website can depict the images of the property and surrounding areas, thereby helping consumers decide whether or not to visit the property on-site and eventually invest in the same. This will also save their time of visiting a location that does not stand up to their expectations.
</p>

<p> 
<b>#3 Customer Support: </b>A real estate website can include a chatbot to answer customer queries as and when they have a doubt regarding the property. This feature will ensure that consumers do not waste time waiting on the phone lines while trying to contact the brokers for simple queries. In addition, timely customer support also increases the company's credibility among the customers, adding up to your brand loyalty.
</p>

<p><b>#4 Property Exposure:</b> Properties listed on the website will always obtain a wider audience reach than word of mouth. The consumer will also be provided with a host of choices, all from a single dashboard. The feedback given for every listing/ agent/ broker enlisted on the website will provide added insight to the customer's decision-making process.</p>


<h2>Technologies to Develop a Real Estate Website
</h2>
	<img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/trulia-Technologies-to-Develop-a-Real-Estate-Website.jpg" alt="trulia-Technologies-to-Develop-a-Real-Estate-Website">

<h3>Pro-tips:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>In the US, Multiple Listing Services (MLSs) are technologically supported by the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR). This body ensures the interoperability of data between MLS systems. As of 2020, there were 597+ MLSs in the US. Brokers that participate in an MLS agree to share their listings with other MLS participants.</p>
	</li>
		<li>
		<p>MLSs allow real estate portals like Trulia to publish MLS listings on their websites. This data is shared with participating brokers or software technology partners through their own web APIs. Trulia gets access to local MLSs by negotiating data sharing and syndication agreements. </p>
	</li>
		<li>
		<p>In the US, public property details should comply with rules established by the NAR and must adhere to the IDX (Internet Data Exchange) policy. To enable data exchange between an MLS database and the real estate website, you need to integrate IDX. </p>
	</li>
		<li>
		<p>IDX is a set of standards, rules, and technologies that track real estate data as it moves from an MLS to your website. IDX moderates how your website accesses MLS data and how it's publicly displayed.
</p>
	</li>
		<li>
		<p>Depending on the MLS that your website pulls the data from, your platform can get listings through different methods, including iFrame, FTP, and RETS. Recently, the most popular method is the RESO Web API. However, there are third-party services that also provide APIs for this task. For instance, SimplyRets, ATTOM Property API, and Mashvisor API. 
</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cost of Building a Website Like Trulia</h3>
	<img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/trulia-Cost-of-Building-a-Website-Like-Trulia.jpg" alt="trulia-Cost-of-Building-a-Website-Like-Trulia">
<p>Depending on whether you opt for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) or a full-fledged development approach, the cost and working hours for building a real estate website can vary. 
An MVP focuses on building only the most important features. Once the MVP is released into the market, customer feedback is analyzed on the product, and changes are made accordingly. In case of full-fledged development, all the website's functionalities are first built, and then the final product is released in the market.
Here is a breakdown of the cost and working hours involved in developing the functionalities for an MVP website (front end and back end):
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>FEATURE</th>
    <th>TIMELINE</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Architecture/DB</td>
    <td>56 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Design</td>
    <td>250 Hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Home page</td>
    <td>48-56 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>User Profile/Account Creation</td>
    <td>35 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Login (Social login, Google Sign-in), Restore password</td>
    <td>24-30 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Search Results with Images/ Videos</td>
    <td>32-45 hours</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Search filter</td>
    <td>32-40 hours</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Map for search results (to display location of property and basic details of surrounding area)</td>
    <td>24 -30 hours</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Deployment</td>
    <td>40 hours</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>Real Estate Agent interface</th>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Log In, Account Creation, Password recovery</td>
    <td>28 -30 hours</td>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>User / Customer Page Management (Dashboard to view user requests, upload property images)</td>
    <td>72-85 hours</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>Admin Panel</th>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>Admin Login, Forgot Password</td>
    <td>4 hours</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Dashboard Management</td>
    <td>16-20 hours</td>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>Property Dashboard Management</td>
    <td>16-20 hours</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Estimating an hourly rate of $35, the cost of creating a real estate website (MVP) may go up to $25,000 to $40,000. To build a more advanced website with functionalities like AI chatbots, Maps with neighborhood details, etc., the cost can very well go from $50,000 to $100,000.
