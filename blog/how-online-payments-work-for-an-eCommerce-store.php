                            <p>Online payments are an integral part of <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/blog/challenges-to-tackle-while-creating-an-ecommerce-marketplace" target="_blank"><b>eCommerce marketplaces</b></a> today with about 42% of eCommerce transactions being carried by digital/ mobile wallets. It takes a robust and secure payment mode to carry such a huge volume of transactions online. Online payment gateways like PayPal and Stripe provide the means for these transactions. Today, about 87.5 percent of online buyers use PayPal. A payment gateway simply authorizes and authenticates funds transfer between a buyer and the eCommerce site (seller). This means an eCommerce site can request money from a customerâ€™s bank for products or services that they have purchased. Once verified and approved, the payment is then securely transferred from the bank.
