							<p>• By adding your targeted keywords in titles of the webpage.</p>
							<p>• By describing the crux of the webpage under 200 characters in Meta tags. The content written in the Meta description should be eye-catching and must tempt the searcher to click on your webpage link.  </p>
							<p>• By adding superior and other power words like How, tutorials, Top, etc.</p>
						
						<p><b>b) Images:</b> Images must be added to the webpages to give a unique experience to the visitors and help them understand your perspective easily.</p>

							<p>• Names of images should be relevant to the image content.</p>
							<p>• Uploaded images should be of small size so that they load faster and keeps a balance between the content and its displayed presentation.</p>

							<p>• Heading H1 and title of the page can be same. (Not mandatory)</p>
						
						<p><b>d) Keywords:</b> They should be included in your webpages so that they can help you to boost your SERP ranking.
