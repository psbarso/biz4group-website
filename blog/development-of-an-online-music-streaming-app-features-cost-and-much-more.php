						<h1>Development of an Online Music Streaming App: Features, Cost, and much more!</h1>
						<p>
Music streaming apps have always been a convenient way for listeners to access their favorite artists and tracks- anytime and anywhere! One of the main reasons behind the immense popularity of music apps is that today almost everyone is connected to a seamless network connection, even on low bandwidth. Moreover, most music apps can run in the background without keeping the mobile screen active- in contrast to video streaming apps like Youtube. Also, the music streaming app helps listeners discover lesser-known artists and new songs, while artists find a platform to display their talents and gain a broader user base.</p>
					<p>Apps like Spotify have taken the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22262508/spotify-q4-2020-earnings-subscriber-numbers-users-podcasts-audiobooks" target="_blank"><b>market</b></a> by storm- with over 340 million active users, 155+ million paid subscribers, and about 40% share of the global music streaming market. <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-18/spotify-founder-and-ceo-daniel-ek-discusses-the-economics-of-music-streaming/" target="_blank"><b>Reports</b></a> depict that between 2014 and 2020, the revenue generated by music apps rose up to 500%. Additionally, In 2021, Spotify <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotify-has-had-stellar-growth-why-its-latest-estimates-are-worrisome-51612373809" target="_blank"><b>projected</b></a> that its monthly active users would grow to 407 million to 427 million. This is not surprising as there are 186.7 million <a href="https://learn.g2.com/streaming-statistics" target="_blank"><b>digital music users</b></a> in the U.S. alone! 
</p>

<p>Now that we are clear on why you should consider developing a music streaming app, let's get into the nitty gritty details. Here are some essential factors to consider while developing a music streaming app that will help your business stand apart from the competition in the market.

</p>

<h2>What are Types of Music Streaming Applications?</h2>

<div class="img" style="padding:7px 0; text-align: center;">
	<img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/spotify-What-are-Types-of--Music-Streaming-Applications.jpg" alt="spotify-What-are-Types-of--Music-Streaming-Applications">
</div>

<p>Music streaming applications can be divided into three categories: 
</p>

<p><b>#1 Radio Streaming Services</b></p>
<p>This allows customers to either manually tune to a particular radio channel or listen to the pre-set radio stations. The can listen to playlists curated in terms of genres, artists, and a lot more. 
</p>
<p><b>Example</b>: AccuRadio, iHeartRadio, SiriusXM.
</p>

<p><b>#2 Music Media Libraries</b></p>
<p>Music Media Libraries allow users to obtain access to unlimited songs on a monthly subscription basis. For a limited amount of songs, some of these apps also offer free listening. 
</p>
<p><b>Example</b>: Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud. </p>

<p><b>#3 Cloud Storage Based Music Players</b></p>
<p>These platforms allow the users to organize, manage and listen to media files that fall under specific categories or genres.
</p>
<p><b>Example</b>: CloudPlayer, pCloud, AudioBox</p>


<h2>Monetization of Audio Streaming Apps</h2>
<div class="img" style="padding:7px 0; text-align: center;">
	<img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/spotify-Monetization-of-Audio-Streaming-Apps.jpg" alt="spotify-Monetization-of-Audio-Streaming-Apps">
</div>
<p>As a business owner, even if you plan on offering a free-to-download music app, two monetization opportunities can help you gain sales and popularity across your target region.
</p>


<p><b>#1 Subscription Model</b></p>
<p>The app offers free and premium versions to the users according to their listening preferences. This model can be on a monthly or yearly basis. Spotify is an example of a subscription-based model. Users who do not subscribe will have to listen to ads within short intervals of time. If users opt for a paid subscription, they can avoid the ads that interfere with their listening experience.
</p>

<p><b>#2 Advertisements</b></p>

<p>Other companies can pay you to run their ads on your app. These ads can either be shown as a pop-up on-screen or between-song intervals.
</p>
<p>You can also choose to mix the monetization models as per your preference!</p>

<h2>Must have Development Features</h2>

 <h2>
Types of Music Streaming App Development
</h2>
<p>The timeline to develop the application has a significant impact on its cost of development. Therefore, you can either opt for an MVP model (Most Viable Product) or a full-fledged development approach.
</p>
<p>In the MVP approach, an app with only the most essential features is developed and put out in the market. Then, based on customer feedback, the app is modified, and a better version is released.
</p>
<p> In case of full-fledged development, the app will be released for use only when each and every feature is completely developed and tested. 
</p>
<p>In both cases, the time to market differs drastically. But, more importantly, in the case of an MVP, you will be able to analyze market requirements and build on the app's features accordingly. As a result, there is no risk of developing a component that is not required by your target audience- thereby saving development time and cost.

</p>
<h2>Cost and Turn Around Time</h2>
<div class="img" style="padding:7px 0; text-align: center;">
	<img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/spotify-Cost-and-Turn-Around-Time.jpg" alt="spotify-Cost-and-Turn-Around-Time">
</div>
<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
	
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th><b>Features</b></th>
			<th><b>Timeline</b></th>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>UI/UX design</td>
			<td>150-180 hours</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>User Login and Profile</td>
			<td>40- 60 hours</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Content Search</td>
			<td>120-150 hours</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Payment Gateway</td>
			<td>80-90 hours</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Admin Panel</td>
			<td>200-250 hours</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Social Sharing</td>
			<td>60-70 hours</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Personalized Music Recommendation</td>
			<td>100-150 hours</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Music Player</td>
			<td>70-90 hours</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Player manager </td>
			<td>70-80 hours</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>

<p>Considering the above features, the total cost for MVP development in the USA would range from $20,000-$30,000. On the other hand, an app with advanced functionalities, third-party APIs, etc., can be priced between $50000-$60000.
</p>
