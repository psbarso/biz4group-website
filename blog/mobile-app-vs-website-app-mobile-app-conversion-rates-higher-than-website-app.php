						<h1>Mobile App vs. Website App: Mobile App Conversion Rates Higher than Website App</h1>
						<p>In the race to make a niche in the market, brands often face difficulty creating awareness for their business, retaining customers and obtaining higher conversion rates. </p>

						<p>This article will take you through the specifics of a mobile app and a website app and the role they play in determining conversion rates for your business.</p>

						<p>First, let's understand the minute difference between a mobile app and a website app.</p>

						<p>A website app is basically a website that is built to be optimized and scaled for mobile devices. Since your mobile's screen is smaller than a desktop, a website app has typical features like smaller fonts, lesser page elements, and smaller white space than desktop versions. A mobile app is a program that can be accessed via the internet or even stored locally on your device. On the other hand, Mobile apps use the native features of a device to create intuitive and quality user experiences for the customers.</p>

						<p>The first rule to maximize your conversions is to target an audience on the platforms they are using the most. Practically speaking, almost everyone today has their eyes locked onto a mobile device! A mobile phone is never too away from an arm's reach.
Since mobile apps are already loaded directly onto a user's phone, the only thing your target audience has to do is click on it to access any information. This eliminates the three steps involved in accessing a website app- open a browser, search for your website, then click on the appropriate tab to search required information. That can be a lot of steps while using a smaller screen as compared to a desktop. On the contrary, it literally takes seconds to access your site from an app- one click, and the app brings everything to your fingertips!
</p>

<h2>Let's have a look at some Interesting Statistics:
</h2>
<ul>
	
<li>    On average, mobile apps have a conversion rate of 157% compared to web apps
</li>
<li>    90% of a consumer's time on mobile devices is spent using phone apps.</li>

<li>    10% of mobile usage time is spent on the web</li>

<li>    52% of worldwide Internet traffic is from mobile devices</li>
<li>   70% of consumers state that push notifications are useful</li>
<li>  40% of users engage with a push notification within an hour of receiving it</li>
<li> Push notifications drive upto 7x higher engagement rate compared to email engagement</li>

</ul>

<h2>Why do Mobile Apps Contribute to a Higher Conversion Rate?</h2>

<h3><b>#1 Better Communication</b></h3>
<p>
In order to generate revenue for your business, you need to keep engaging with your target audience. A well-designed mobile app with in-app updates, 24/7 customer support, and push notifications will help your business communicate with users with suggestions on personalized products or services based on their interests and behaviour, thus increasing the possibility of a conversion. Push notifications play an important role in getting customers to try out new products (check the statistics above)
</p>

<h3><b>#2 In-App Features</b></h3>

<p>A mobile app gives you access to some of the basic features of a user's smartphone. For example
</p>
<p>GPS</p><p>Camera</p>
<p>Contact lists</p><p>Compass</p><p>QR Code Scanner</p>

<p>These features can be utilized to make your business app more engaging. 
Suppose a user wants to make an in-app payment. The payment wallet installed on the user device can be used to perform the transaction seamlessly.  Now imagine doing the same thing from a mobile website? The modest efforts to add a credit card as a payment method, then adding the 16 digits in the input field, putting down the user's name, card expiration date, and card verification code, is quite a bit of work to type on a small screen manually. Even if a small mistake is made in the process, the whole transaction fails and it can frustrate the user, causing them to abandon the purchase. 
</p>
<h3><b>#3 Offline Capabilities</b></h3>
<p>The most significant feature of a mobile app is that some of its features can be accessed offline. Depending on your business needs, you can provide as much offline access to your customers as needed. A mobile app can still deliver plenty of functionality while users are offline.  For example, Netflix, a global leader in video streaming, allows users to download videos to their mobile devices via the mobile app and watch them later while offline. 
</p>

<h3><b>#4 Loading Time and Speed</b></h3>
<p>Compared to a mobile app, a web app takes more time to load. In today's fast-paced world, if your platform is slow, any user will drop out without hesitation, resulting in an increased bounce rate on your website. The loading time and speed depend on the algorithms and restrictions added within the app stores and search engine. Since mobile app data is stored locally on each unique device, retrieving the data to load relevant content takes place instantaneously. Mobile apps have lesser bounce rates and abandonment rates because they are fast, thereby leading to better conversion rates.</p>

<h3><b>#5 Faster Support
</b></h3>
<p>Live chat integrated into a mobile app makes for a seamless customer experience. 
Users can quickly communicate with your business via live chat, email, or phone by selecting any preferred option from your app's menu options.
This experience can be time-consuming on the web apps- since inputting queries on a smaller and condensed version of the page can be frustrating. Yes, you can integrate an AI robot or chatbot on the page- but again, it can get frustrating for the end-user and therefore lead to a not-so-good user experience.
</p>

<h3><b>#6 Brand Presence
</b></h3>
<p>An average user spends almost every day on their device and its installed apps. This daily activity can be a branding opportunity for businesses. Even when a user is not using the app, the icon's mere visual on their screen reminds them of the brand associated with the app.
</p>

<h2>Let's Summarize: 
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Apps can send push messages that keep customers engaged with your business</li>
		<li>Brand awareness is high via a mobile app since the app icon will be visible to the user while they explore their phone.
</li>
	<li>Apps retain user data, leading to faster load time
</li>
	<li>Apps offer better personalization as compared to a mobile website.
</li>
	<li>Apps offer a better communication channel.
</li>
	<li>Apps can leverage mobile device features for a seamless user experience 
</li>

<li>Mobile apps can even provide some offline features.

</li>
<li>On average, people spend more time on apps as compared to mobile web browsers. 

</li>
<li>Apps drive engagement and increase customer retention rates.
So there you have it! Without any debate or comparison, mobile apps beat website apps in almost every category, thus driving higher conversion rates for your business</li>
