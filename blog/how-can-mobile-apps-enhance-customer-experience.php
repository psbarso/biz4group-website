                            <h1>How Can Mobile Apps Enhance Customer Experience?</h1>
                            <p>Today’s technology-driven world has essentially shifted to a mobile-first approach. Most users prefer the use of mobile apps to carry their daily activities, be it for shopping, business, communication, or education. One of the main reasons behind this trend shift is the proliferation of technology and customer experience transformation. Mobile apps have turned ubiquitous, especially in the online shopping domain, where nearly 85% of consumers prefer intuitive mobile apps over mobile/ desktop version. This rising trend of mobile application development unequivocally has a great impact on how customer experience functions in various different settings, which could leave a long-lasting change to the business itself.</p>

                            <h2>How well does a business app serve?</h2>
                            <p>Learning from the immense popularity garnered by utility apps, businesses are looking for ways to realize the business interests of enterprise-specific apps as well. Blake Morgan, a customer experience expert, agrees that Businesses should use half of their energy and time to work on mobile application development. While the potential of mobile apps is indisputable in today’s customer-centric business world, the competitive nature of the user market makes it quite onerous to create a winning app.</p>
                            <p>Nonetheless, businesses can surely capitalize on mobile apps to improve the customer journey by creating an engaging online customer experience. Especially in the eCommerce line-of-work, enterprises can derive actionable insights from the user data collected from shopping apps. This information can be instrumental in delivering enhanced customer experience through personalized offerings. Not to forget, the incredible marketing opportunities that mobile apps bring along.</p>
                            <p>Market research shows that users who have a negative experience on a mobile website areis 62% less likely to purchase from the same online store again. Focusing on an important factor like customer experience could greatly decide at which point in time your business would potentially show the most growth. Growing competitiveness in the eCommerce domain has made customer experience (CX) a decisive factor for the growth and success of an eCommerce business. It is one of the key differentiators in today’s aggressively competitive business world. As a result, businesses are keenly focused on strategies to improve and magnify their efforts in this specific field.

                            <h2>Mobile apps for better CX</h2>
                            <p>Technological advancements are certainly outpacing the applications at an unprecedented rate. However, the decisive factor behind business success remains the same; customer experience. For an <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/ecommerce-development">eCommerce business</a>, it still is one of the greatest challenges to overcome. Only with great customer service, businesses can thrive in today’s fast-paced global economy. By putting mobile apps to use, businesses can significantly improve customer service and create much more meaningful and advantageous engagements.</p>
							
							<h3>Here’s how a mobile app can help improve your customer experience and promote better engagements.</h3>
							<img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/here’s-how-a-mobile-app-can-help-improve-your-customer-experience-and-promote-better-engagements.jpg" alt="banner" />
							
							<h4>1)	Understanding customer journey and behavior</h4>
							<p>With mobile commerce soaring up in the popularity charts, businesses have got easy access to a myriad of user data, that can help them deliver personalized and effective customer service. With meaningful data at hand, business owners can improve their service offerings based on every customer’s preference, which, in the case of a traditional website would have been unattainable. Enterprises monitor customer segments, customer behavior, purchasing behavior, and many such operative elements to derive insights. </p>
							<h4>2)	Additional channel for engagement</h4>
							<p>Unlike on a website, mobile apps are not bound by a short session of use. Website visits are often short-lived and therefore lack the scope of connection at the end of each session. Mobile apps, on the other hand, allow for constant engagement through push notifications for the latest updates, offers, discounts, and more. This is also a reason why the UI on a mobile app should be equipped with latest technological advancements and various features which could improve customer experience. 
								Mobile apps also form an integral part of omnichannel engagement strategy today. Because customers wish to have a streamlined shopping experience across all devices, businesses need to focus on more than one channel to facilitate their needs. A mobile app can serve as an “always available” communication channel, thereby increasing your ability to deliver better customer service. 
								To improve customer experience through the use of mobile apps, mobile payment is a great aspect of it. Mobile payment is still on the limited side but it would greatly improve the convenience of the app to the customers. Even if only two methods of payment are made available, it could still increase the consistency and time of the customers on the app. 
							</p>
							<h4>3)	Convenience</h4>
							<p>According to market statistics, business apps are the second most popular category of apps, with game apps being the most popular. One of the main reasons behind the unprecedented popularity of mobile apps is the convenience and rapidity they bring. Users can engage with your online shopping business much more quickly and conveniently. Also, apps are known to simplify the shopping journey by a considerable margin. As an additional perk, shopping apps can also improve the sales process by allowing users to set up repeat orders and notifying them of the early availability of orders. </p>
							<h4>4)	Improved marketing strategy and Personalization</h4>
							<p>A personalized offering is one of the most sought-out features among the modern consumer base. About 80% of shoppers are more likely to buy from a company that offers personalized experiences and 59% of customers say that personalization influences their shopping decision. By engaging with the customers via a mobile app, businesses can custom-tailor their services to best-suit customer preferences. They can even upsell their products by analyzing customer’s buying behavior and providing relevant deals to them. With actionable insights close at hand, marketing strategies seem to work even better, as the marketing teams already know about the customer trends. </p>
							<h4>5)	Improved productivity and reduced cost</h4>
							<p>Mobile apps also serve as a unifying platform to bring employees, vendors, and customers together. For end-customers, it is especially beneficial as they are readily assisted on the same platform, they use for placing orders. For businesses, a unified platform brings increased productivity margins by at least 20% to 40%. With updated sales charts and effective reporting tools to analyze customer data, businesses can manage their inventories to bring off sales fluctuations and seasonal mop up. With in-app branding and marketing features, the cost of marketing and advertisement can also be reduced drastically. </p>
							<h4>Summing it up</h4>
							<p>According to market research, users spend 87% of their time on apps compared to just 13% on the browser. A fully-functional shopping app can essentially serve a much larger consumer base than a traditional website. Mobile apps have essentially turned ubiquitous today, with people using them to do nearly everything in their day-to-day life. Due to their unprecedented popularity, mobile apps serve a great business interest as well. Apps can be instrumental in understanding and improving customer journey. Additionally, they can also be used as a great means to improve marketing strategy and boost their business towards a customer-centric approach.
