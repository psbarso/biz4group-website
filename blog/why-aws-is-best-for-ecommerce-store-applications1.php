                            <p>The inclination of shoppers has certainly shifted from the conventional brick and mortar stores to the much more convenient <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/blog/challenges-to-tackle-while-creating-an-ecommerce-marketplace" target="_blank"><b>eCommerce marketplace.</b></a> This gradual shift has created unprecedented market opportunities for business houses who wish to procure improved market growth and revenues by setting up online retail stores.</p>
                            <p>However, the transition to this fiercely competitive business vertical has its own set of challenges. The roadmap to a successful eCommerce business consists of a very dynamic array of determinants including platform architecture, marketing strategy, UI & UX along with value proposition and security. It takes a fair share of aesthetical, functional, and operational efficacy to turn site visitors into buyers. </p>
                            <p>By the year 2021, the eCommerce industry would account for over 4.48 trillion US dollars in sales, making it one of the biggest industries in terms of market share. The exceptional growth in the eCommerce industry has soon made it the new norm across the shopping sphere. In this transition from offline to online sales, cloud technologies have been of considerable importance, delivering crucial infrastructure and services essential for boosting eCommerce efficiency.</p>

                            <h2>Why Choose Cloud Hosting Over On-Premise Servers</h2>

                            <p>Deciding upon the best-suited backend infrastructure for your eCommerce platform can be highly cumbersome at times. As a business owner, you need to decide between the traditional on-premise infrastructure and cloud business model depending upon the scope and requirement of your project. After the successful development of numerous <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/blog/why-security-and-privacy-control-are-crucial-while-implementing-an-ecommerce-solution" target="_blank"><b>eCommerce solutions</b></a>, our developers at Biz4Group encourage the adoption of cloud infrastructure due to the following benefits</p>



                            <h3>Cost</h3>

                            <p>On-premise infrastructure is comparatively costlier than cloud solutions and often needs a dedicated team of IT professionals for the management and upkeep of the system. Cloud hosting, on the other hand, brings perks such as infrastructure maintenance, data security, platform upgrades, and bug fixes.</p>

                            <h3>Security</h3>

                            <p>Data security offered by cloud hosting service can easily beat an on-premise server by a huge margin. With cloud-based services backing your eCommerce transactions, you can rest assured about the financial data and platform integrity.</p>

                            <h3>Almost Zero Downtime</h3>

                            <p>Server downtime directly affects the profitability of an eCommerce store and renders the website useless for a considerable amount of time. Since the sales cycle is completely cut short, revenues along with customer experience are affected badly. By signing up with cloud hosting, your business store will experience more than 99% of uptime with little to no loss to the operations. </p>

                            <h3>Backup Processes</h3>

                            <p>
                                Data insights play a crucial role in determining the success of an eCommerce store. By utilizing product and customer data, business owners get to act upon the trends much early. In order to secure user data, setting up server backup becomes imperative. With cloud hosting, your website data can be easily backed-up, either automatically or on-demand. With the availability of both onsite and off-site storage facilities, cloud hosting further improves store management and enhances disaster response strategies.
                            </p>

                            <h3> On-Demand Scalability</h3>
                            <p>Cloud hosting brings along a myriad of functional benefits for your eCommerce platform which on-premise solutions fail to offer.</p>

                            <h3>Amazon Web services</h3>

                            <p>In today’s fast-changing world of eCommerce, AWS integration has become synonymous to achieve scalable success for your eCommerce platform. <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/" target="_blank"><b>Biz4Group</b></a> is an advanced AWS technology partner that allows our development teams with technical as well as comprehensive competence to ensure the success of your eCommerce business.</p>

                            <p>The integration of Amazon Web services (AWS) with the eCommerce platform helps the platform easily handle the growing user traffic without opting for additional hardware or computational resources. It is one of the most popular and reliable cloud platforms to set up an online retail store.</p>

                            <h2>Why AWS Is Best for eCommerce Store Applications?</h2>

                            <p>Let’s discuss in detail about various advantages that make AWS an exceptional choice for <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/ecommerce-development" target="_blank"><b>eCommerce development</b></a>. In simple terms, Amazon Web services are cloud-based infrastructure-related applications that can easily be scaled and configured depending on the business requirement. One good reason to opt for AWS instead of on-premise infrastructure is that it nearly eliminates the overhead cost of resources when the platform starts to scale. </p>
                            <p>Amazon itself being the world’s largest eCommerce company understands the know-how of leading the market space. Because of this, AWS carries the customary benefit of experience and expertise which you can integrate within your business platform to gain the competitive lead. The services offer you technological precedence for better interaction, engagement, and sales prospects. AWS infrastructure is also more secure, flexible, and compatible in comparison to on-premise solutions.</p>

                            <h2>AWS Architecture </h2>

                            <p>To further simplify the roadmap to setting up an eCommerce platform, AWS cloud offers CloudFormation templates that can be integrated with just a few clicks. With the correct cloud configuration and architecture, your eCommerce business will always be ready to scale in situations of an unexpected surge. </p>

                            <h2>Handling traffic surge</h2>
                            <p>With conventional hosting solutions, numerous websites report sudden crashes during the peak shopping season. However, with AWS cloud, issues related to scalability and traffic handling nearly fade away. The platform provides dynamic traffic handling by scaling up the necessary resources as and when required.</p>

                            <h2> Data backup</h2>
                            <p> AWS is a world leader in providing cloud computing solutions to SMB’s and large enterprises working in the eCommerce domain. One of the key differentiators that set it apart from its competitors, is its ability to tackle situations leading to system failures or server damage. By ensuring operational integrity, AWS enables smooth and error-free functioning of the servers at any given point in time.</p>

                            <h2> Security and Regulatory Compliance</h2>
                            <p> While dealing with sensitive personal and financial data you need to ensure that there are zero flaws in the security and regulatory setup of your online marketplace. By default, AWS brings specialized infrastructure to ensure state-of-the-art platform security and compliance for eCommerce projects. Our developers at Biz4Group incorporate the latest security measures along with AWS security certificates like Payment Cards Industry (PCI) and Data Security Standard (DSS).
                                Moreover, the cloud architecture also comes with tools like web-application-firewalls, compliance ‘checkers,’ etc. to ensure the best security practices.</p>

                            <h2> Platform Compatibility</h2>
                            <p> Along with core product catalog and checkout services, the eCommerce platform hosted on the AWS cloud comes with inherent compatibility with nearly all the CMS available in the development realm. It also provides added support and SDKs for robust platforms like Ruby, Java, PHP, Node.js, and .Net.</p>

                            <h2> Availability of Nearest Datacenter</h2>
                            <p>While hosting your eCommerce platform on AWS cloud, you get the vantage of choosing the most befitting datacenter from any of its 66 availability Zones across 21 geographic regions around the globe. By securing the right datacenter or CDN hosting in your selected region, you can ensure quick query handling even during increased customer traffic.</p>

                            <h2> Pricing Models</h2>
                            <p> One of many reasons for choosing AWS cloud over on-premise infrastructure is its flexible pricing model. With AWS, you get a pay-as-you-go pricing or fixed monthly billing model. This essentially means that you only pay for the resources you use.
                                As an advanced AWS technology partner, we carry a substantial lead in eCommerce development with up to 10x speedier and cost-effective solutions.</p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>“Cloud infrastructure provides Merchants with exceptional performance, unrivaled flexibility, agility, and resource availability. In an increasingly agile business world, we think that AWS eCommerce hosting is the future.” Tom Ashworth, Technical Director</p>
