						<p class="spac-top">An eCommerce platform is the core piece of the puzzle when it comes to the success or failure of an online business. It allows business owners to manage their products, sales, and other operations with little or no knowledge/experience of programming. This, in turn, helps them create a seamless shopping experience for the customers, leading to a better rate of conversions, increased brand loyalty, etc.
						</p>

						<p>With online shopping maintaining its popularity over the last few years, it is of utmost importance that your eCommerce store
							 stands out from the rest of the competition in the market. In 2020, 2 billion+ consumers purchased goods or services 
							 online, and during the same year, e-retail sales surpassed 4.2+ trillion U.S. dollars worldwide(<a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/871/online-shopping/" target="_blank">Source</a>). This trend has
							  become a big hit, and it will not be wrong to say that it is surely going to be here for a long, long time. Therefore, this is the right time to consider launching your eCommerce store with a platform suitable to your business needs.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Choosing an eCommerce platform for your online business involves comparing its architecture, functionalities, price, scalability, and many other features. There are two software architectures: Open source and Software as a Service (SaaS). Suppose you are unsure about choosing the right option for the success of your eCommerce platforms. In that case, we at Biz4Group, one of the most reliable and expert eCommerce development Company, are right here to help you decide which type of solution better fits your business needs.

</h2>					<img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/difference-between-saas-eCommerce.jpg" style="padding: 6px 0;" alt="difference-between-saas-eCommerce">

					<p>First, let's start by understanding the meaning of SaaS eCommerce and Open-Source eCommerce.</p>
					<h2><img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/rombus.png" alt="rhombus"> Software as a service</h2>


					<div class="factor-point">
								<div><img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/rightIcon.png" alt=""></div>
								<p>This is a software licensing and delivery model in which the software is licensed on a subscription basis. </p>
							</div>


							<div class="factor-point">
								<div><img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/rightIcon.png" alt=""></div>
								<p>SaaS software isn't bought or installed on individual computers. It is hosted and maintained on the cloud by a third party. This is also referred to as web-based or hosted software which is licensed out to merchants to use.</p>
							</div>



							<div class="factor-point">
								<div><img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/rightIcon.png" alt=""></div>
								<p>You may access these applications via web browsers and pay a monthly subscription rate depending on the level of service and number of users.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="factor-point">
								<div><img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/rightIcon.png" alt=""></div>
								<p><span> </span>Since the eCommerce provider builds, hosts, and maintains the software on their servers, users are limited in their ability to edit or change the software's source code.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="factor-point">
								<div><img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/rightIcon.png" alt=""></div>
								<p><span> </span>Popular Examples of SaaS e-commerce platforms are Shopify and Shopify Plus, Volusion, BigCommerce, Squarespace, etc.</p>
							</div>





<h2><img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/rombus.png" alt="rhombus"> Open Source eCommerce</h2>



                          <div class="factor-point">
								<div class="factor-point-img-div"><img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/rightIcon.png" alt=""></div>
								<p>Open-source software is developed in a publicly collaborative way and can be downloaded from communities like GitHub.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="factor-point">
								<div class="factor-point-img-div"><img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/rightIcon.png" alt=""></div>
								<p>Open-source software allows users to view, change, and distribute its source code for their purpose.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="factor-point">
								<div class="factor-point-img-div"><img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/rightIcon.png" alt=""></div>
								<p>Merchants have full access to the software's source code; hence, if functionality is missing, your business can leverage coders to build it. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="factor-point">
								<div class="factor-point-img-div"><img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/rightIcon.png" alt=""></div>
								<p>Popular examples of open-source eCommerce software are WooCommerce, X-Cart, Prestashop, OpenCart, Magento, etc.  </p>

		</td>
		 <td> <p>Even though the open-source eCommerce platform is free to download, these platforms have a good amount of work and coding needed to get 
			your eCommerce store up and running. Additional time needs to be invested in getting hosting, security, and theme building.</p></td>
		  <td><p>SaaS platforms have user-friendly UIs and pre-built themes to help you set up your online store- with little to minimal coding knowledge.
			 No additional time is invested in hosting and security.</p></td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		    <td><p>Security / PCI Compliance</p></td>
		    <td><p>Open-source platforms leave PCI compliance to their users. Your business will have to maintain PCI compliance standards and stay
				 updated with any patches or bug fixes for security firewalls. Additionally, they do not have a dedicated support team.
				  In case of an issue or bug, your technical team would have to solve it by themselves. You may leverage the support from large
				   communities of developers who use this platform for advice and assistance when needed.</p>

<p>The clear winner is the SaaS eCommerce platform with its range of benefits like low cost, easy setup, and great support, which will help your business thrive and flourish. 
</p>
<p>To sum up, a SaaS solution is "off-the-shelf," meaning the effort of developing the product is already in place, reducing its cost significantly. This makes them an ideal choice for businesses without strong IT knowledge who want to start an eCommerce store as soon as possible and without all the associated fuss.
</p>
<p>What's more? With a SaaS-based platform, there is no need for someone to physically be near the main server to access data and valuable information of the eCommerce Store. Since all the data is stored on a cloud database, access can be granted to anyone with the required credentials, from anywhere, anytime!</p>
