						<h1>Your Complete Guide to Developing a Video Social Media Application like TikTok</h1>
		
						<p>Social media is a promising market to establish a niche for your business. Here are some interesting <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/" target="_blank"><b>statistics</b></a>  to prove this claim:
</p>
						<ul>
							<li>53.6% of the population worldwide uses social media</li>
							<li>The average daily usage for various social media apps is 2 hours and 25 minutes. </li>
							<li>In the last 12 months, 316 million new users globally have come online</li>
							<li>As of January 2021, TikTok and Instagram are among the top 10 most used social media apps worldwide. </li>
							
						</ul>

						<p>It is the internet age, where users want to communicate, share, like, and discover content that is relevant to their needs. It could be for self-affirmation, attention, communication or creating an image for themselves. Social media usage has considerably increased due to the pandemic since everyone is stuck at home and is socially isolated- but connected with the world thanks to social media.</p>

						<p>Apps like Tiktok aim to provide its audience base with three major features:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Self-expression 
							</li>
							<li>
								Public outreach
							</li>
							<li>
								Discovery of like-minded individuals 
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>These three features are what make it so popular among audiences of different demographics. The fact that you can connect with individuals globally and demonstrate your art is a whole new ballgame that users of different age groups have started to explore. 
Since many countries have banned TikTok, now is the right time to create a similar application to replace this popular social media application. 
</p>

<p>
This article will guide you through the features, methodology of development, and other specifics that will help your business come up with a similar app without any hassle.

<h2>How to Create a Video Sharing Social Media Application?
</h2>
<p>Step 1: Consider the Purpose and Objectives of the Application from a User's Perspective
Answer questions like why would a user want to install and use your application? 
What features would people expect from this app? How will your app address content, functionality, and ease of use requirements? 
</p>
<p>Step 2: Creating a Strategy for your Application
Thoroughly study the idea by analyzing the competitive field and user requirements, finalize your target audience, and establish key performance indicators to be achieved.
</p>
<p>Step 3: Curate a team!
Developing a video-sharing social network app requires a great deal of effort and a full-fledged development team to ensure app development. The team required includes:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		UI/UX professionals
	</li>	<li>
		Android, iOS or cross platform developers
	</li>	<li>
		Project managers

	</li>	<li>
		Backend and frontend developers

	</li>	<li>
		Quality test professionals
	</li>	<li>
		 Support and maintenance professionals

	</li>
</ul>
<p>
Step 4: Design the Application Workflow
This phase can include steps like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Wireframing-</b> helps the development team visualize the structure of social media applications and provides a holistic overview of the input/output functionalities throughout the application.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Prototyping-</b>  creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) helps developers gain a better understanding of the additional features to be added or unnecessary features to be eliminated from the application.
	</li>

</ul>

<p>Step 5: Development and Quality Assurance 
This phase is where the development team will choose a stack for development and, empowered with the design team's wireframes, will replicate the app specifications.
The quality test professionals can then test every functionality developed- either iteratively or all at once- along with specifics related to the application's backend, databases, APIs, storage, and other nitty-gritties. At every stage of development, it is recommended to conduct manual or automated testing. 
</p>
<p>Step 6: Publishing and Marketing
Once the app is published, create all promotional materials, including video guides and blog articles, to help the app stand out on the platform of choice (Example- Apple Store or Google Play Store).
</p>
<p>
Step 7: Maintenance and Support
After the application is released to the market, ensure that steady support, bug fixes and security patches are released on a timely basis.
</p>
