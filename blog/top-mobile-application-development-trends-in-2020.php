Indeed, that is the reason blockchain is the real game-changer in mobile development trend. </p>
						<h2>Internet of Things</h2>
						<p>IoT isn't any singular tech, but an amalgamation of different technologies put together that are going to change the epoch of digital transformation. Developers across the world are leveraging IoT to create intuitive platforms to control different IT and non-IT equipment via mobile apps. </p>
						<p>With almost every tech company, ranging from startup to MNCs binging on IoT, the market share for IoT investment is set to cross USD 120 billion by 2020. Some of the examples for this are – Android Ubidots, Xively, Thingworx, etc. it won't be an exaggeration to say that IoT has become altogether a new industry segment in the recent times and its deployment in other industries has made it the golden goose of the modern age. Today's application development trends are greatly dependent on IoT, as it <a href="https://www.biz4intellia.com/solutions/" target="_blank"><b>gives a real-time solutions</b></a> to complex business problems and bridges the gap between different service requirements simultaneously. </p>
						<h2>Beacon Technology</h2>
						<p>Healthcare, Hospitality, Travel and Retail are the leading industry verticals that are leveraging the newly developed Beacon tech for geo-location tagging and proximity marketing. Today, this beacon tech merged with IoT has become part of leading mobile app development trends and helping hotels, resorts, hospitals, retailers and others to enhance their business. </p>
						<p>From the consumer point of view, we can state that beacon tech-enabled apps easily guide its users to find their preferred products, their costs and other related info in real-time. This tech utilizes BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) signals and proposes great avenues for the marketing sector. Apple's iBeacon and Google's Eddystone are the two big examples of beacon tech developed on iOS and Android platforms, respectively. In 2020, this tech is expected to get leveraged in the fields of sports, mobile payments, travel and tourism as well. </p>
						<h2>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
						<p>Artificial intelligence has shaken the very roots of civilization since its inception. The days aren't far when everything around us could be controlled and managed using the AI. Though there has been a constant debate in the pros and cons of AI, yet when it comes to the latest trends in mobile apps, the role of AI is getting bigger by each passing day. AL enabled Machine learning is also helping the users in different verticals by learning human actions and activities. </p>
						<p>The integration of AI and ML has made iOS and Android app development a lot easier than before. If we have to encircle the potential work areas for AI and ML, prediction of user behaviour, IoT integration, subject camera identification, cybersecurity, and language translations are just a few among others. </p>
						<p>If it doesn't ring a bell directly, think of Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and others similar smart mobile assistants that are helping smartphone users in their day-to-day life. Voice and speech recognition, text prediction, calendar management, and office administration are just some of the application of this tech. Statista has forecasted AI market to grow to USD 12.4 billion in 2020 and majority to that stack will be in mobile apps only. </p>
						<h2>Wearable Application</h2>

Some of the finest examples of this miniaturization of technology come in the form of wearable tech. These wearable apps encompass a more significant share of the new age mobile app development trends.</p>
						<p>The market for wearable devices has grown exponentially in the last decade. The wearable statistics as per the website 3dinsider was 39.5 million in the year 2015, the estimated number of adults in the US to use some sort of wearable devices has grown to 81.7 million in 2018. This figure clearly reflects a good portion of adults who use wearable devices own more than one device. At the Global level, It is estimated that by 2021, the number of wearable devices that will be purchased in the US is expected to reach more than 559 million units.</p>
						<p>Unlike normal mobile applications, in modern app trends, Wearable Apps are expected to carry out functions that are a lot more unique and creative in various aspects.
