						<h1>Why Choose MERN Over Magento For eCommerce Store?</h1>
						<p>The eCommerce industry vertical is growing at a tremendous rate with expected worldwide sales of over $4.2 trillion USD in the year 2020. This flourishing trend has fairly been leveraged by sizeable businesses and SMEs. Today, more and more enterprises are shifting their focus onto the eCommerce domain to gain improved market growth and revenue streams. Talking about industry records, the worldwide eCommerce sales went from USD 1.3 trillion in 2014 to a whopping USD 4.9 trillion in 2021, showing a growth rate of about 265%. Going forward, the eCommerce industry will continue with this upward trend and create better market opportunities for both market leaders and newer players. </p>
						<h2>Point of Interest</h2>
						<p>The ability to “earn while you sleep” has made eCommerce one of the buzz words across the business realm. Every business, small or large scale, wants to jump on the bandwagon and reap the most out of its business potential. However, successful deployment and operation of an online store is in fact anything but easy. Biz4Group has extensive knowledge of the ever-changing trends in the eCommerce domain. Our eCommerce development teams make sure the proposed solution is best suited for your business type and market. <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/ecommerce-development" target="_blank"><b>Custom-built eCommerce solutions</b></a> help your business flourish well in today’s fast-changing marketplace where businesses need to align their work process with modern technology stack. </p>
						<p>Be that as it may, the increasing popularity of open-source solutions like Magento has majorly transformed the world of eCommerce development. Emerging businesses and SMEs are relying on online CMS platforms to create and run their own marketplace. However, these solutions fail to deliver optimum results when your business starts to scale. Moreover, customizing the functionalities in lieu of changing market trends can be really difficult to deal with online site builder solutions. Partnering with a trusted eCommerce solution provider like Biz4Group can help brands garner better profit margins and scale their business much efficiently and quickly.</p>
						<p>We have put together a few critical points on why to choose MERN over Magento for your eCommerce store.</p>
						<p>MERN is one of the most powerful and applicative technology stacks for custom eCommerce platforms. Right from the front-end design to impressive customer experience, with MERN you get a one-stop solution for all your eCommerce operations. There are several benefits of choosing MERN stack, some of which are</p>
						<h3>1. Simple learning curve</h3>
						<p>JavaScript-based MERN stack is quite simple to understand and highly proficient in terms of functionality. On the other hand, users have a hard time customizing eCommerce platforms built on Magento. Also, it takes lesser efforts in customizing and scaling your platform when it is developed in the latest tech stacks like MERN. </p>
						<h3>2. On-demand Scalability</h3>
						<p>Lot many developers are devoted to the MERN stack for eCommerce projects because of its ability to scale the platform at will. On the contrary, scalability has been a major challenge for Magento based platforms. </p>
						<h3>3. Code Reusability</h3>
						<p>Both front-end and back-end technologies in MERN stack support extensive code reusability which allows for quicker time-to-market (TTM) and ease of development.</p>
						<h3>4. Operational Speed</h3>
						<p>Each of the components in the MERN stack holds to the performance aspect of your business platform. Be it the frontend framework or the schema-less database, you get up to 10 times speedier performance with MERN stack.</p>
						<h3>5. Rich Library sets</h3>
						<p>React is a popular JavaScript library that helps the developers to create intuitive UI for your online marketplace. Unlike Magento, MERN developers get access to a rich set of code library which considerably simplifies the development process.</p>
						<p>It is a known fact that an eCommerce business needs to stay in line with the changing interests of its customers and market trends. To deal with this unpredictable nature of the eCommerce domain, our developers at Biz4Group prefer <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/blog/7-reasons-to-choose-mern-stack-for-e-commerce-development" target="_blank"><b>MERN-based development</b></a>. With extensive customization and scalability, MERN is your best pick for a successful eCommerce solution. </p>
						<p>In recent times, a number of SMEs have chosen Magento to build their eCommerce platforms but later migrated to robust architecture like MERN. Here are a few drawbacks of using Magento which you need to consider while developing an online marketplace.</p>
						<h2>Performance Lag on Shared Servers</h2>
						<p>While setting up an online eCommerce store, many businesses prefer small or shared servers to cut down on the heavy expenditure. While Magento-based platforms are natively fast, they fail to deliver optimum speed on shared hosting setups. One of the main reasons behind this drawback is the Magento system which carries a bulk load of more than 20,000 files and 200 database tables.</p>
						<h2>Time-To-Market</h2>
						<p>Magento has always been criticized for its steep learning curve. Developers can have a tough time building an online store and launch it within a strict timeline. Our eCommerce team at Biz4Group can develop and deploy an online store within 5 to 7 weeks. With a quick launch, your business can acquire a competitive lead across the market and ensure a successful route to success. </p>
						<h2>Complicated Customization</h2>
						<p>Customization is one of the many USP’s of MERN stack and also a major shortcoming while dealing with platforms like Magento. The popular CMS carries a heavily layered and complicated code which can cost you a lot of time to get well-versed with. At its core, Magento is built on the Zend framework and doesn’t really apply best practices like object-oriented programming to simplify customization. </p>
						<h2>Heavy Expenditure</h2>
						<p>For eCommerce development, Magento offers a basic community version for free. For emerging businesses, this could be a suitable solution to fulfill their requirements. However, it becomes extremely difficult for medium and large businesses to compete in their respective markets with the community version. They’d definitely have to purchase the enterprise version but a price of USD 18,000 stands as a huge investment for any business owner. Moreover, Magento platform still has a lot of bugs which tend to create a negative impression on the customers.</p>
						<h2>Technical Support</h2>
						<p>While running an eCommerce store, the possibility of facing a security breach or sudden downtime is very common. For a business, this can bring a huge loss in terms of customer satisfaction and maintenance costs. Having a 24*7 technical support is a must to have in such a scenario. By partnering with a custom eCommerce development agency, you can always get instant support and ensure smooth functioning of your business platform even in times of usage spike.</p>
						<h2>Final words</h2>
						<p>Lately, there has been a rise in the number of businesses choosing Magento CMS for building their online stores. Similarly, there are various other platforms that can help you kick-start with your eCommerce journey but none can compete with the efficiency and applications of MERN-based business solutions. <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/" target="_blank"><b>Biz4Group</b></a>, a leading enterprise solution provider, can help you achieve your market goals with nothing but the best of technical prowess.
