                <h2>Factors that make Netflix an excellent choice to become your app model</h2>
                <p>• Netflix offers a wide range of genres to its subscribers to stream, anytime and anywhere. </p>
                <p>• Netflix has successfully built its relationship with Smart TV companies like Sony and LG and gaming companies like PlayStation and X-Box. They have around 35+ partners globally.</p>
                <p>• Netflix has an effective subscription model and pricing strategy. Viewers can choose from three types of subscriptions plans, including
                <ul>
                  <p>○ Basic Streaming: $8.99/month</p>
                  <p>○ Standard Streaming: $12.99/ month</p>
                  <p>○ Premium Streaming: $15.99/ month</p>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>• The AI algorithm used in Netflix recommends shows that the user might prefer after studying the user's watching history. This has increased its popularity amongst the user base by manifolds,</p>
                <p>• Additionally, Netflix has a Domestic DVD segment, which helps it drive more revenue from monthly subscription fees for services consisting of DVD by mail.</p>
                <p>• Netflix advertises through online channels to gain more subscribers and traffic. </p>
                <h2>Revenue</h2>

                  </a> ) </p>
                <ul>
                  <p>• Netflix is the world's seventh-largest company on the internet by revenue</p>
                  <p>• This video streaming platform has over 180 million users from all over the world.</p>
                  <p>• Netflix video streaming platform has nearly 183 million paid memberships from all over the globe.</p>
                  <p>• In 2020, Netflix's profit for the first quarter was about $5.8 billion. </p>
                  <p>• This income is also inclusive of capital obtained through advertising- charging companies for placing them inside the video streaming app and the concept of "Freemium," where users have to pay to access some exclusive videos.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>If your app plans to follow the business model of Netflix, you can be guaranteed that it will be a hit amongst your target audience. Let's now dive into the technical details of creating a video streaming app.</p>
                <h2>Recommended Technology Stack/ Development Tools </h2>
                <p>With robust technology that can scale itself to support an increasing number of users, the app should also have a very strong database to support all the content and user information that will be stored within it. The database will form the very spine of your application!</p>

                <h2>Development Cost and Working Hours </h2>
                <p>The development cost and timeline of the project are majorly dependent on whether you want to develop an MVP (Minimum viable product) or opt for a full-fledged development. In the MVP mode, you can create the basic and most important features and release the product in the market. Based on customer feedback, you can then modify or even drop add-on features. This helps save a lot of development time and effort and lowers the risk of creating an app with features that the target audience may not welcome. </p>
                <p>In case of a full-fledged development, you create the entire app with all the decided features and then release it in the market. </p>
                <p>Now, for an MVP product, here is a breakdown of the features and time required to develop the same:</p>
