						<h1>To Build or To Buy: Custom eCommerce Website Development vs. COTS</h1>
						<p>For every eCommerce service provider, the first dilemma comes in the form of the software for the same. Every eCommerce deals with the problem of building a customized software or buying a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software. While both the options come with their own set of advantages and disadvantages, it is debatable which one is better.</p>
						<p>Before deciding on one, it is important to understand the various parameters that distinguish one from another. This article is aimed at exploring those factors that can help you comprehend your requirements and what suits your needs best. </p>
						<h2>Custom or Off-the-Shelf Solution?</h2>
						<p>The first thing to consider when deciding on a software solution is your requirements. It is important understand how unique are your needs and if they are available in an off-the-shelf solution. COTS solutions are designed for a mass audience that provide a general set of features that cannot be changed as per needs. Whereas, customized software is developed keeping in mind the unique requirements of the user. Custom solutions are developed in-house from scratch which gives the developer the liberty to create designs and features as per the needs of the user.</p>
						<p>Even if you do find the features you want in an off-the-shelf solution, there might be features that you don’t need but you will end up paying for them which is a drawback that one cannot avoid. A COTS solution can simply be described as packaged product that cannot be altered. It is something you brought off the store and will have to pay the asked price for.</p>
						<p>Another thing to consider is if you will need to customize your software in the long run. Most off-the-shelf solutions don’t offer the option of customization. The remaining that claim to have customizable solutions only allow a specific level of customization that may or may not fulfill your needs. So, it’s always best to consider your needs in the future and if the COTS solution will serve you well when the requirements arise.</p>
						<p>An important factor to consider is the cost of developing a custom software as compared to COTS solution. Needless to say, an off-the-shelf solution can be bought from an online store easily in a couple of bucks which can prove to be pretty handy. However, what many eCommerce service providers fail to understand is that it doesn’t just end there.</p>
						<p>In the long run, there are always expenses that arise while maintaining an off-the-shelf solution. License renewals, version upgrades and advanced features are to name a few. So, if one is to consider these repetitive expenditures, then building a customized software may cost a little too high while developing it but maintaining it is a lot less costly. </p>
						<p>In simple words, it is a one-time investment that may prove to be fruitful in the long run. However, customized software also comes with its own set of drawbacks. The major roadblock being the availability of the service provider. In a COTS solution, issues can always be resolved by customer support. Whereas, in a custom software you have to rely on the service provider which may not be a good idea as they may move, be unavailable or simply go kaput. </p>
						<p>Of the other factors that matter is time. Software development takes a great amount of time whether you build a customized software or buy it off-the-shelf. So, it is always best to consider the time limitation when choosing between the two. While buying a COTS eCommerce solution is an ideal option when you need a quick fix, customized software can be a time-consuming option. </p>
						<p>Furthermore, customized solutions are specifically designed to meet every requirement as compared to off-the-shelf which will offer you a pre-produced set of features. </p>
						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>In the end, it is safe to say that both customized software and COTS solution have their own benefits and drawbacks. So, the criteria to decide between the two should be based on all the factors. The idea is to decide on a solution that fits all your needs and proves to be feasible in the long term.</p>
