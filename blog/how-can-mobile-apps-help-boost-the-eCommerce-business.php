                            <p>Smartphone interactions have increased manifold in the last decade, making it quite a standard in the consumer world. Online shopping is one such area. Almost four out of five Americans shop online, and more than 50% of them use a mobile device for shopping. Statistics also show that mobile shopping delivers twice the revenue as compared to traditional modes. In 2017, total eCommerce sales through mobile devices reached up to 34.5% of total ecommerce sales. By 2021, mobile ecommerce sales are expected to scale up to 54% of total ecommerce sales. The stakes are really high, especially in mobile commerce, where stiff competition and ever-changing customer trends can hold up the profit margins quite easily.</p>
