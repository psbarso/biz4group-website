                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Market research and requirements gathering</b>
                                    <p>Before taking the project to a development agency, always try to do your bit of market research in order to analyze and list down the project requirements. By doing so, you can easily align your project requirement with a favorable scope and timeline for the project and also know about the leading <a href="https://www.biz4group.com/blog/challenges-to-tackle-while-creating-an-ecommerce-marketplace" target="_blank"><b> eCommerce trends for online marketplaces</b></a>. With a list of all key parameters and functionalities in advance, you can be well aware of what you need from a development company.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Client reviews and testimonials</b>
                                    <p>Checking the company’s reviews and testimonials posted by their prior clientele will let you know a lot about their work process and expertise. It is arguably the most important point to consider while selecting a development agency as it brings a lot of crucial intel onboard. Reviews and testimonials not only validate the company’s credibility but also help you understand the company's work culture.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Project portfolios </b>
                                    <p>Always look for a development firm that has appreciable experience working in your target segment. This simply means, look for a development company that has prior experience in delivering an eCommerce store that is closely related to your business type. By assessing a company’s relevant work experience you can also understand their acuity and vision.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Study the profiles of developers</b>
                                    <p>When you come on board with a development agency, it isn't the agency but the assigned team of developers and designers that play a major role in your platform's success. In order to ensure the best development work, always request for the list of team members along with their respective work profiles to understand the strengths and assess their weaknesses. As a business owner, you can also put-up certain questions and set up expectations regarding creative inputs and process refinement.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Cost</b>
                                    <p>The cost of development is another crucial factor to consider while selecting a partner for your eCommerce journey. You should always request a detailed cost estimation with a feature-wise breakdown for components like design, database configuration, server management, and functional development. Once you have a few proposals to compare, choose the one that best suits your requirement based on credibility, experience, and pricing.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Time to market (TTM) </b>
                                    <p>Time to market is a crucial factor while deciding upon the project estimation. Ideally, professional development firms like Biz4Group can bring your eCommerce store to life within a matter of 5 to 6 weeks. However, you also need to make sure that the coding practices are top-notch in quality to launch a bug-free website with reduced development time.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Language of communication</b>
                                    <p>Language can be a potential barrier while working with development agencies on a global level. Right in the initial evaluation phase, make sure to review your partner’s communication skills and the medium of communication. If the development partner isn’t available for physical meetings, make sure they are available on alternate channels such as Skype chat or Google hangout for a quick chat.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Post-development support</b>
                                    <p>Post-development support is a very important factor that can help you stay on top of your service provisioning even after the development contract ends. Your business may need additional services like server management or digital marketing support. Always look for a partner that can offer more than what is listed so that your current, as well as future needs, can be met.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
