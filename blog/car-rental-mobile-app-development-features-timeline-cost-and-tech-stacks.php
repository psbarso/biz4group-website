						<p>•	To handle and manage payments, we recommend using Braintree SDK or Stripe API.</p>
						<p>•	Firebase SDK is one of the best tools so far used by our team to implement Push Notifications.</p>
						<p>•	If you want to integrate car databases, you can use, for instance, Europcar, Hertz, Avis, and Alamo to develop a Car Rental App like Rental cars, which is a mobile aggregator.</p>
						<p>•	One of the most significant tasks of your application is integration of maps and for this Google Maps Platform can be a suitable tool.</p>
						<p>•	We generally recommend developing the app using React Native, which will allow you to build a cost-effective cross-platform app with native UX.</p>
						<h2>Cost to Build a Car Rental App</h2>

So, the complete process can be integrated into several parts that start from computing the number of hours required.
