                        <p>The logistics sector is one of the few domains that operate 24*7 with stringent timelines and dependencies. The boom in the eCommerce industry is one of the leading factors contributing to its growth. The global logistics market is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/logistics-market-size-is-projected-to-reach-usd-12-256-billion-by-2022---valuates-reports-301065076.html" target="_blank"><b>expected</b></a> to reach $12.25 trillion by the year 2025!</p>
                        <p>A delivery management app for a logistics company will help streamline operations for both the company and the app users. Logistics is an intricate department and involves minute details that strengthen the seamless flow between order placement and the delivery process. If any of the moving pieces in this sector malfunction, the entire process can go for a toss. An app is a perfect medium to overlook fleet management, warehouse management, employee management, and customer management- anywhere and anytime!</p>
                        <p>If you are a logistics company, you can relate to scenarios when your driver calls midway to tell you that the vehicle has broken down or a customer repeatedly calls to ask about the courier's whereabouts. A logistics app will be a great helping hand to keep these situations in check.</p>
                        <p>This article will give you an overview of the features that make up a logistics application and the overall costs of developing a quality-centric app.</p>
                        <h3> Features of a Good Courier/Logistics Application</h3>
                        <p>The primary purpose of a good logistics/ courier company is to streamline the multiple processes that are taking place at the same time. There are three major dimensions of a logistics application- user end, driver/ employee end, and admin end. Let's take a quick look at all three:</p>

                        <div style="padding:7px 0px">

                        <h3>Advantages of a logistics app </h3>
                        <div style="padding:7px 0px">
                         <img src="<?php echo SITE_URL;?>images/courier-or-logistics-app-development-advantages-of-a-logistics-app.jpg" alt="courier-or-logistics-app-development-advantages-of-a-logistics-app">
                        </div>
                        <h4>Additional features of a Logistics app</h4>
                        <p>To ensure that your app stays ahead in terms of sustainability and scalability, your logistics apps must comprise the following features :</p>
                        <p>• In-app chat</p>
                        <p>• Get a quote</p>
                        <p>• Link & upload docs</p>
                        <p>• Multilanguage support</p>
                        <p>• Driver safety</p>
                        <p>• Cloud storage </p>
                        <h2>How much does the development of a Logistics Mobile App Cost?</h2>
                        <p>Considering the fact that your app will include individual panels for admin, end-users and drivers here is a breakdown of the factors that add up to the total development cost:</p>
                        <h3>#1 Backend and frontend development stack</h3>
                        <p>The development tech stack that you consider should be inclusive of the front end, database, payment gateway, real-time analytics, push notifications, and server technology to be used. Additionally, if you opt for advanced features like an automated chatbot for personalization purposes, there will be a cost incurred for AI as well.</p>
                        <p>Here is a quick overview of languages that can be used-</p>
                        <p><b>•	Front end-</b> HTML, CSS, React, Kotlin, Bootstrap, Swift</p>
                        <p><b>•	Back End-</b> Python, Angular, JavaScript</p>
                        <p><b>•	Cloud-</b> Google, Azure, AWS</p>
                        <p><b>•	Payment Gateways-</b> PayPal, Stripe</p>
                        <p><b>•	Analytics-</b> IBM, CISCO, Hadoop</p>
                        <p><b>•	Push Notifications-</b> Firebase, Twilio</p>
                        <h3>#2 Platform</h3>
                        <p>Decide on whether the app will be developed for Android, iOS, or cross-platform. Cross-platform enables the same application to work on both Android as well as iOS platforms, thus allowing for much easier implementation and faster deployment.</p>
                        <h3>#3 Development Team Size</h3>
                        <p>It’s an infamous saying in the development realm, "Effort equals cost". You can either choose a team of freelance developers or a well-established <b><a href="https://www.biz4group.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank" >mobile app development</a></b> company to create your application. Keep in mind that the number of team members will influence the cost of the project.</p>
                        <h3>#4 Post-Launch Support</h3>
                        <p>Make sure to understand whether the cost of development covers post-launch support. You will need developers to fix security patches or provide support after the app goes live.</p>
                       
                        <h3>#5 Minimum Viable Product or Direct Output</h3>
                        <p>A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) comprises all the basic functionalities of the application. It enables the stakeholders to decide which features to retain, drop or add, thereby saving on the app's total investment.</p>
                        <p>To summarize, app development with all the features mentioned above, a ballpark estimate would be around $30k USD-$70k USD. This number will solely depend on the features that are to be included in the app. If you want to integrate advanced features into your logistics app, the charges can go higher. </p>
                        <p><b>Make your logistics mobile apps revenue-generating:</b></p>
                        <p>An excellent advantage of logistics mobile apps is that not only do they boost the growth of your business but also allow you to generate a good amount of revenue through other factors. These are :</p>
                        <p>• Paid apps</p>
                        <p>• Advertisements</p>
                        <p>• Commission</p>
                        <p>• Paymium models</p>
                        <p>• Freemium models.</p>
                        <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>There is simply no denying the fact that a  well-formulated application can revolutionize your transportation and logistics business by maximizing delivery volumes in minimum time while tracking all the moving pieces in a standardized and organized manner. <b><a href="https://biz4group.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biz4Group</a></b> is a globally renowned <b><a href="https://www.biz4group.com/ecommerce-development" target="_blank" >eCommerce development agency </a></b> with a seasoned team of expert developers, designers, and project managers.
