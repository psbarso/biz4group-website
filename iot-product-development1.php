		<p>Internet of Things has made possible creation of networks of all sizes that can span across a set of geographical areas. The interconnected network of IoT has resulted from the convergence of various technologies like real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity and embedded sensors, and other modern devices. The Internet of Things development has contributed to concepts ranging from smart homes, smart cities, smart solutions across industries, security systems, and other appliances. In the consumer market, IoT has become synonymous with products and solutions pertaining to smart/ automated ecosystem. </p>
		<p>Further, IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) devices collect and analyze data from various sources to regulate and monitor industrial functioning. With a structured approach built around a functional ecosystem, IoT can successfully create a positive asset-value chain comprising of things, data, processes, and people, which can, in turn, create a sustainable growing business environment.</p>
